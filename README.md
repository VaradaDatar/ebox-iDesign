Git allows us to track or preserve the history and version of a file. Consider you have a word file, you either overwrite every saved file with new saves, or you save multiple versions. With Git, It keeps “snapshots” of every point in time in the project’s history, so you can never lose or overwrite it.  Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. And it helps the team cope with the chaos that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.
